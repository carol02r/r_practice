# MY472: Mid-Term Problem Set (summative)

### Deadline: Monday, 25th November 2024, 17:00 London time

_Since many students find weekdays to be very busy, I decided to move the deadline so that you can use the weekend of the 23rd to work on the problems (if you would prefer to do so)._

--- 

### Introduction

This assignment is a **summative** assignment that is worth 50% of your final mark in MY472.

**Please note: as is the case for all assignments in this course, your mark and/or feedback on all assignments in MY472 will be partly based on your ability to clearly and effectively communicate your ideas, thoughts and workflow to us. This mimics what you would do as a data scientist in an academic and/or professional setting. Keep in mind that MY472 is *not* simply a course in how to code; it is a course about data science more generally.**

### Submission logistics using GitHub Classroom

For all assignment in MY472, you will need to submit your solutions via GitHub Classroom using a Git/GitHub workflow like you have seen in lecture and seminar.

When you clicked on the assignment link that I sent in a course announcement, it would have automatically created a private repo in your GitHub account. We refer to this as your "Submission Repo" for this assignment. It initially includes this README file, as well as the problem set exercises ([`MY472-AT24-ps2.Rmd`](MY472-AT24-ps2.Rmd)), a template file where you will put your answers for each exercise ([`MY472-AT24-ps2-answers.Rmd`](MY472-AT24-ps2-answers.Rmd)), and any other supporting files you will need.

Your Submission Repo is _private_. It is where you will store your work and it is where we will collect your answers after the deadline. There is no official "submission" process in GitHub Classroom: at the deadline, you will no longer be able to make any changes to your Submission Repo and the course instructors will have automatic access to your Submission Repo. Simply work on your files in your Submission Repo freely until the deadline. Please note that after the deadline, you should no longer make any changes to your Submission Repo, and you may be automatically blocked from doing so by GitHub.

**Exercise 1 spells out how you should structure your Submission Repo and where you should write your answers.** In general, unless explicitly instructed to so, you should not add new files, rename files, rearrange files, remove files, etc. 

After you complete the exercises _but before the deadline_, you should do the following:

1. Knit (to HTML) your solutions to each exercise in your local copy of your Submission Repo.
2. Commit and push the final versions of all your work contained in your local copy of your Submission Repo.
3. Visit your Submission Repo on <https://www.github.com> to ensure all the files are the versions you intend to submit.

This is very important: **Your Submission Repo must look exactly as we specify in Exercise 1. All your files and folders must be committed and pushed to GitHub/remote before the deadline.**

##### Some fair warnings about submitting your answers correctly

Your mark for every assignment will be based on what the markers are able to see in your Submission Repo, so _please, please, **PLEASE** do not forget to commit and push your changes to remote on GitHub and check the files on GitHub are up-to-date_. Corrupted, illegible, missing, renamed, or otherwise damaged files will not be marked. We will only mark the last versions of your files that were committed and pushed before the deadline. We will not contact you to correct any problems with the files in your Submission Repo. It is your responsibility to ensure you submit your work correctly. Failure to do so will cause you to receive zero marks and no feedback. **Please note (again) that if your Submission Repo does not look exactly as expected (e.g., if you rename or move files), it will not be marked.**

### Style and formatting requirements

Unless stated otherwise, you will be evaluated on the contents of _one_ knitted `.html` file that you provide to us _for each exercise_. (See instructions in Exercise 1 and above.) You should treat each of your answers as a professional "report" to the instructors. Part of our evaluation of your solutions will consider how professional, clear and organised your "report" is.

Some specific guidelines:

* You must show all your work and explain everything you are doing.

* You must present all answers in full sentences, as you would in a report or academic piece of writing.

  * If the exercise requires generating a table or figure, you should include at least one sentence introducing and explaining it. E.g. "The table below reports the counts of Wikipedia articles mentioning the LSE, by type of article."
  
* Unless stated otherwise, all code used to answer the exercises should be included as a code appendix at the end of the script. This formatting can be achieved by following the guidance in the [`MY472-AT24-ps2-answers.Rmd`](MY472-AT24-ps2-answers.Rmd) script included in your Submission Repo.

* All code should be annotated with comments, to help the marker understand what you have done.

* Your output should be reproducible. Any result/table/figure that cannot be traced back to your code will not be marked.

* For each exercise, use **section headers** to divide up your work into each part. For example, you should begin Part 1 of Exercise 1, with the following section header in your Rmd file for Exercise 1: `#### Part 1`.

* If your Submission Repo or your answers do not seem professional, neat and/or organised, you will lose marks. Remember: your job is to _communicate_ to the markers that you have learned the material and developed the requisite skills.

### Anonymity and marking

Please do not put any personally identifiable information (such as your name) inside any file that you include in your Submission Repo, except for your LSE candidate number. Every assignment is marked anonymously, meaning that the marker will not know who you are, assuming that you have followed our instructions *not* to include personally identifiable information in any file in your Submission Repo.

For every assignment, you will be asked to put your LSE candidate number on the top of your answers file. We will track your progress in the course using your LSE candidate number.

You may choose to submit your assignments under your main, personal GitHub account or another "anonymised" account that you create for the purposes of submitting assignments in MY472. Please note that even if you choose to use your personal GitHub account, your solutions will still be marked anonymously, as the course convenor will anonymise each students’ submission before allocating them among the course markers.

### Extensions

We will not ordinarily grant extensions to individual students unless:

1. You have a pre-approved adjustment or accommodation and have requested an extension.

2. You have formally requested an extension from the Department and it has been granted. Please see the Assessments section of the Moodle page to review the Department’s extension policies and procedures.

If you have been granted an extension through either of these two processes, you must inform the course instructors ASAP so that they can modify your deadline in GitHub Classroom. To do so, please forward any email you receive from the Department to the convenor within 1 day of receiving it.

### Collaboration, ChatGPT and academic integrity

You may work with other students and/or visit office hours for help with your assignments. However, any work you submit in MY472 must be your **own original and independent work**.

While you may use outside resources and/or chatbots like ChatGPT for support, but you must cite all sources and clearly and explain how you used any chatbots to arrive at your answers.

If anyone or anything (e.g. ChatGPT) **_substantially_** completes your solutions on your behalf, this will no longer be considered your own original and independent work and will be considered academic misconduct.

More generally, it should go without saying that plagiarism, unauthorised collaboration, re-using prior work, and fabrication of data are all serious breaches of academic integrity and constitute violations of LSE's policies. The instructors actively monitor the integrity of student assessments, and suspected violations of LSE policies will be investigated and referred for disciplinary measures as appropriate. 

Keep in mind that a student's lack of awareness about the expectations for academic integrity at LSE is _not_ a valid defence against an allegation of academic misconduct. So, if you are unfamiliar with the norms and expectations around academic integrity at LSE, please review them here:  <https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/services/assessment-and-results/exams/exam-discipline-and-academic-misconduct>

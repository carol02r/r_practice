# MY472: Mid-Term Problem Set (summative)

### Introduction


**Exercise 1 spells out how you should structure your Submission Repo and where you should write your answers.** In general, unless explicitly instructed to so, you should not add new files, rename files, rearrange files, remove files, etc. 

After you complete the exercises, you should do the following:

1. Knit (to HTML) your solutions to each exercise in your local copy of your Submission Repo.
2. Commit and push the final versions of all your work contained in your local copy of your Submission Repo.
3. Visit your Submission Repo on <https://www.github.com> to ensure all the files are the versions you intend to submit.


### Style and formatting requirements

Unless stated otherwise, you will be evaluated on the contents of _one_ knitted `.html` file that you provide to us _for each exercise_. (See instructions in Exercise 1 and above.) You should treat each of your answers as a professional "report" to the instructors. Part of our evaluation of your solutions will consider how professional, clear and organised your "report" is.

Some specific guidelines:

* You must show all your work and explain everything you are doing.

* You must present all answers in full sentences, as you would in a report or academic piece of writing.

  * If the exercise requires generating a table or figure, you should include at least one sentence introducing and explaining it. E.g. "The table below reports the counts of Wikipedia articles mentioning the LSE, by type of article."
  
* Unless stated otherwise, all code used to answer the exercises should be included as a code appendix at the end of the script. This formatting can be achieved by following the guidance in the [`MY472-AT24-ps2-answers.Rmd`](MY472-AT24-ps2-answers.Rmd) script included in your Submission Repo.

* All code should be annotated with comments, to help the marker understand what you have done.

* Your output should be reproducible. Any result/table/figure that cannot be traced back to your code will not be marked.

* For each exercise, use **section headers** to divide up your work into each part. For example, you should begin Part 1 of Exercise 1, with the following section header in your Rmd file for Exercise 1: `#### Part 1`.

* If your Submission Repo or your answers do not seem professional, neat and/or organised, you will lose marks. Remember: your job is to _communicate_ to the markers that you have learned the material and developed the requisite skills.
